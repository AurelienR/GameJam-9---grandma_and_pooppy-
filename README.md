A GranMa bought a lizard that appeared to be a Kaiju.

You are the Kaiju, game you have to go with gran'ma to the post office. Will you succeed to be nice?
The game is devided into two game phases:

- First one is to avoid to cruch humans and try to reach the post office by being "nice"
- Second, if you fail you enter into "Rampage" mode and have to reach
the post office fastest as possible. Try to crush as many human as you can but the army
will try to stop you.
- BONUS: you can try to catch a "suit" bonus to switch from rampage mod into first mod.
